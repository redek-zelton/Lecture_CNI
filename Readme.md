# Read A French ID CARD

## Tools

### OpenCV
OpenCV (for Open Computer Vision) is a free graphics library, initially developed by Intel, specialized in real-time image processing.
The robotics company Willow Garage and the company ItSeez have taken over the support of this library.
The OpenCV library provides a wide range of features to create programs from raw data to basic graphical interfaces.
It offers most of the classical operations in low-level image processing: reading, writing and displaying an image; calculating the histogram of gray levels or color histograms; smoothing, filtering; image thresholding (Otsu method, adaptive thresholding); segmentation (related components, GrabCut); mathematical morphology

### Tesseract
Python-tesseract is an optical character recognition (OCR) tool for python. That is, it will recognize and “read” the text embedded in images.
Python-tesseract is a wrapper for Google’s Tesseract-OCR Engine. It is also useful as a stand-alone invocation script to tesseract, as it can read all image types supported by the Pillow and Leptonica imaging libraries, including jpeg, png, gif, bmp, tiff, and others. Additionally, if used as a script, Python-tesseract will print the recognized text instead of writing it to a file.

## Project
Extract all information from an ID Card. Use Image Processing Tools to get all data, picture, and signature. It works well with a good ID Card image.
